## About Me

<div class="about-me">
<div style="flex: 1 1">
I'm a <a href="https://ngp.usc.edu/">Neuroscience</a> PhD candidate advised by <a href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/paul-m-thompson/">Dr. Paul Thompson</a> at the Imaging Genetics Center at the University of Southern California. My research involves diffusion MRI analysis for mapping micro- and macro-structural changes of white matter tracts in neurodegenerative diseases. I'm also interested in developing and applying machine learning and AI methods for large-scale multi-site neuroimaging data to promote reproducibility and reliability of results.
