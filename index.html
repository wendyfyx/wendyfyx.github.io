<h1>About Wendy</h1>

<hr class="solid">

<p>
  I'm a second year master student in the Computer and Information Science (CIS) department
  at University of Pennsylvania, and am currently working in Dr. Li Shen's lab as a graduate
  researcher. I'm interested in developing and applying machine learning methods for high dimensional
  or multimodal neuroimaging genetics data and study how they can inform the understanding, diagnosis
  or treatment of neurodegenerative disease with a genetic basis.
