description: An full stack web application to visualize food nutritional information
---

This is a class project for CIS 550 Database Systems (Fall 2019) at University of Pennsylvania.

We built a full stack web application (see architecture diagram below) using food nutrition data from [Food Data Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html) with features:
- **Food Search**: Search for food by keyword and see their nutritional information.
- **Nutrition Tracker**: Calculate total nutritional content in protein, carbs and fat by searching for food and entering amount consumed.
- **Recommendation**: Recommend food based on user-specified nutritional need (percentage of carbs, fat or protein).
